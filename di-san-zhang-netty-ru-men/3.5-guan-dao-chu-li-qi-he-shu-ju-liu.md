# 3.5 管道处理器和数据流

我们需要看一下您发送或接收数据时会发生什么情况。在本章开始时，我们提到Netty具有处理程序的概念。

We need to take a look at what happens to your data when you send or receive it. Re-call at the beginning of this chapter we mentioned that Netty has this concept of a handler. To understand what happens to data when it is written or read, it is first essential to have some understanding of what handlers are. Handlers themselves depend upon the aforementioned ChannelPipeline to prescribe their order of execution. Thus, it is not possible to define certain aspects of a handler without defining the ChannelPipeline and in turn it is not possible to define certain aspects of the ChannelPipeline without defining ChannelHandlers. Needless to say we must start with one and proceed to the other defining each in terms of themselves and each other. The next subsection will introduce both ChannelHandlers and the ChannelPipeline in a way that makes this cyclic dependency negligible.
