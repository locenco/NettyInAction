# 6.5 Summary

 In this chapter you got an in-depth look into how Netty allows hooking into data processing with its ChannelHandler implementation. The chapter shows how ChannelHandlers are chained and how the ChannelPipeline uses them. It highlighted **the differences between inbound and outbound handlers and the differences in operating on bytes or messages of various types.**

 In the next chapter Ill focus on the codec abstraction of Netty, which makes writing codecs much easier than using raw ChannelHandler interfaces. Also, Ill take a deeper look at how you can easily test your ChannelHandler implementations.
